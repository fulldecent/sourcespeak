Source Speak is a turn-key system for displaying source code on your web site.

Features
--------

**Uses Vim syntax hilighting engine**

  Source Speak uses the Vim engine to highlight the code. Any format supported
  by Vim (virtually everything) will be handled.

**Easily Themable**

All source code highlighting is done by a single CSS style sheet. To change
the look, simply edit `common.css`.

**Attach arbitrary metadata**

  You can display arbitrary metadata with each project, like Author, Version, etc.
  Simply choose the metadata to display in the `config.json` file.
